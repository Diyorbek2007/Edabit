## 35. Buggy code (part 4)

Emmy has written a function that returns a greeting to users. However, she's in love with Mubashir, and would like to greet him slightly differently. She added a special case in her function, but she made a mistake.

Can you help her?

**Notes:**

- READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY, CHARACTER BY CHARACTER!
- Don't overthink this challenge; it's not supposed to be hard.

**Examples:**

```js
    greeting("Matt") ➞ "Hello, Matt!"

    greeting("Helen") ➞ "Hello, Helen!"

    greeting("Mubashir") ➞ "Hello, my Love!"
```

**Tarjimasi:**

Emmi foydalanuvchilarga salomlashish funksiyasini yozdi. Biroq, u Mubashirni sevib qolgan va u bilan biroz boshqacha salomlashishni xohlaydi. U o'z funktsiyasiga maxsus holat qo'shdi, lekin u xato qildi.

Unga yordam bera olasizmi?

**Misol uchun:**

```js
    greeting("Matt") ➞ "Hello, Matt!"
    
    greeting("Helen") ➞ "Hello, Helen!"
    
    greeting("Mubashir") ➞ "Hello, my Love!"
```
